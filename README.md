# Tic-tac-toe-v2
Next.js Minmax Socket.io

## About

### Goal
App was created to practice Next.js and Recoil

### What u can find in this app
For now application alows us to play a game against our Friend on one device or against Ai.
Project is currently suspended => in the future there is a plan to add an Multiplayer mode using Socket.io but due to limited requests on MondoDB cluster i had to stop working on this project for a while probably with different data base. In the latest commit i added NextAuth for SignIn/Up.

#### How to play AgainstAi
1. Go to the Singleplayer mode 
2. Click on the computer icon and u are ready to go.
3. But if u want to let the Ai start then u have to click on the Circle icon before the games start.
